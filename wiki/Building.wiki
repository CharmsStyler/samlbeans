#summary How to build the SamlBeans project

SamlBeans uses <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> to build.  You can use either Maven 2 or 3.

After checking out the project, just run the following:

{{{
> mvn install
}}}

And the .jars will be available in your local disk maven repository ($HOME/.m2/repository) as well as in each module's respective `target` directory.
